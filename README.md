OpenBullet is a webtesting suite that allows to perform requests towards a target webapp and offers a lot of tools to work with the results. This software can be used for **scraping** and **parsing data**, automated **pentesting**, unit testing through **selenium** and much more.

**IMPORTANT!** Performing (D)DoS attacks or credential stuffing on sites you do not own (or you do not have permission to test) is **illegal!** The developer will not be held responsible for improper use of this software.
